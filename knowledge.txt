--------- Tailwind not recognise -------

We add tailwind with Layout.js component that contain next/head component to add tailwind, but the template already use next/head in config.js component that is added in _app.js page, that's to say, all pages contain config.js component and this component overwrite my Layout.js component. Therefore we add tailwind script inside config.js component rather than layout.js component.

-------- axios api not work -----------

axios get api from frontend uri, this was because this line in axios.js:

const clienteAxios = axios.create({
    baseURL: process.env.backendURL		// environment not recognise by next
});

the problem was solved with:

const clienteAxios = axios.create({
    baseURL: process.env.backendURL || 'http://127.0.0.1:4000'
});

Important: if i put http://localhost:4000 rather than http://127.0.0.1:4000 not work because nextjs need numbers no words, 
the words are carried away by the wind
